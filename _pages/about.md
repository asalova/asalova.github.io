I am a sixth year PhD student in Physics at UC Davis working with Professor [Raissa D'Souza](http://mae.engr.ucdavis.edu/dsouza/). Currently, I am broadly [interested](https://asalova.github.io/research/) in the interplay between  the structure and dynamical behavior in systems with dyadic interactions and beyond.
