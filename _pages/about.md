I am a PhD candidate at UC Davis working with Professor Raissa D'Souza. I am broadly interested in the interplay of structure and dynamics in networks and systems with higher order interactions.

I am scheduled to graduate in Spring/Summer 2021 and currently looking for postdoctoral opportunities.

I am interested in analyzing dynamics on networks. Specifically, I am interested in coupled oscillator networks.
