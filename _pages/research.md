I am interested in how the interplay of structure and dynamics in networked dynamical systems is manifested in their states and their stability. My recent work includes analyzing [decoupled states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06163) that arise in networks of linearly coupled limit cycle oscillators. Such states have been shown to be observed in [experiments](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6431/eaav7932). I am also interested in data-driven methods can be applied to dynamics on networked dynamical systems, and how prior knowledge of the stcucture of the system (e.g., its [symmetries](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.5099091)) can be used in data-driven analysis. 
Recently, I became interested in how higher order interactions affect the behavior of networked dynamical systems, as ignoring non-dyadic interactions can lead to mischaracterizing the system's states and their stability properties. Currently, I study how cluster synchronization can occur in systems with higher order interactions ([link to a short video presenting my work at TopoNets satellite of NetSci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXo_vZtmC_Q&t=1s&ab_channel=AnastasiyaSalova)).
