I am interested in how the interplay of structure and dynamics in networked dynamical systems is manifested in their states and their stability. My recent work includes analyzing [decoupled states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06163) that arise in networks of linearly coupled limit cycle oscillators. Such states have been shown to be observed in [experiments](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6431/eaav7932).
