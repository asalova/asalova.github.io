Nonlinear dynamical systems with symmetries exhibit a rich variety of behaviors, often described by complex attractor-basin portraits and
enhanced and suppressed bifurcations. Symmetry arguments provide a way to study these collective behaviors and to simplify their analysis.
The Koopman operator is an innite dimensional linear operator that fully captures a systemâ€™s nonlinear dynamics through the linear evolution
of functions of the state space. Importantly, in contrast with local linearization, it preserves a systemâ€™s global nonlinear features. We demonstrate how the presence of symmetries aects the Koopman operator structure and its spectral properties. In fact, we show that symmetry
considerations can also simplify nding the Koopman operator approximations using the extended and kernel dynamic mode decomposition
methods (EDMD and kernel DMD). Specically, representation theory allows us to demonstrate that an isotypic component basis induces
a block diagonal structure in operator approximations, revealing hidden organization. Practically, if the symmetries are known, the EDMD
and kernel DMD methods can be modied to give more ecient computation of the Koopman operator approximation and its eigenvalues,
eigenfunctions, and eigenmodes. Rounding out the development, we discuss the eect of measurement noise.
